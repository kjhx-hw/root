The interface was styled with <a href="http://primer.style">Primer</a>, GitHub’s style system. Think Bootstrap, but a little more approachable. Like Bootstrap, Primer places a large emphasis on being mindful of mobile devies – though it was incredibly time consuming, going through every page of the site and making it mobile-friendly was actually very easy to accomplish due to the approach Primer takes with mobile-focused styles.</p> <p>Ignoring the design, the most complex part of this project is manipulating the PHP and HTML so that they work together seamlessly, without ever exposing raw error messages from the server to the user. It can get really difficult to follow mentally when you’ve got massive sections of HTML split with PHP all over them all inside a switch or an if statement. I can’t pretend that my code isn’t a little tragic looking, but it works.</p> <p>If you poke around long at all, you’ll notice that some of the webpages are still Dr. McCown’s – I spent time implementing features that weren’t required (like profile pages, primarily) that meant I didn’t have time to make my own settings page or new account form. Still, it’s all functional, and at the time I’m writing this it’s still available on TAZ for you to test.</p> </div> </main> <footer> <div class="container"> <nav class="header"> <img src="/~khuggins/site//assets/images/khlc.png" title="Kyle Huggins" height="20rem" draggable="false"> <a href="mailto:kyle@huggins.io?subject=TAZ">kyle@huggins.io</a> </nav> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
